Within these programs, families will see how engineering is relevant to their lives by connecting with engineers who grew up and currently work in a rural community. Families will collaborate to make and design for the community and celebrate solutions they have designed.

          Children in rural communities find it challenging to access educational resources related to engineering. Even when children engage in engineering learning, it may be difficult to see how engineering is relevant to their lives living in a rural community. Family Makers bring engineering relevant to children and caregivers by connecting with rural engineersâ€™ stories and lived experiences and building relationships with library professionals who can support with lifelong learning at their community.

          Family Makers work closely with eight rural library partners throughout the project to provide input and co-design the online engineering program. The Family Makers curriculum will be tested and refined through several cycles across eight rural library settings to ensure that we design a curriculum that is replicable and scalable. Once it is finalized, Family Makers which will be freely accessible under a Creative Commons license for any rural library to use and implement. We will also provide facilitation and technology guides as well as webinars to support rural libraries to get familiar with engineering concepts and design thinking approach.
